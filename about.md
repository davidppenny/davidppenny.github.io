After eight years of successfully implementing Lean Management techniques across a variety of fields, Iâ€™m seeking to combine this experience with data science and enter the world of Tech. My natural ability as an organizer, a builder and a leader has allowed me to help grow various companies as well as start a few of my own. My education as well as my entrepreneurial nature has created in me an insatiable desire for success and a broad tool belt spanning engineering, design and marketing.

### More Information

My earliest childhood memories are of adventure. Seeing what's around the corner, exploring the unknown and boldly going where no 5-year-old probably should have gone. There's something captivating about experiencing something new or being on the edge of a new discovery.

I'm still adventuring daily but now it's through the realms of data. Nothing excites me more than finding relationships and clusters in my work. I might be the odd one out who actually REALLY enjoys data cleaning. I also find the occasional day to dive up to 120ft in the Pacific Northwest.
